Battery Protection System
Written by Correia, Paul and Li, Lun

Abstract
    The Battery Protection System (BPS) serves two functions. The first is to
monitor the state of the battery packs used in the solar vehicle, the individual
voltages and temperatures of each battery module as well as the total current of
the battery system. Voltages and temperature will be measured by a combined
sensor attached to the outside of each battery module, while the current will be
measured via a Hall Effect sensor. Should the voltage of any battery be over or
under a dangerous threshold, the temperature of any battery be over a dangerous
threshold, or if the current be over a dangerous threshold, the BPS system 
will shut down power flow via two kilovac relays for the motor and MPPT. The 
second task of the BPS is to send data via CANBus containing data about the
temperatures and voltages of each battery and the current, as well as if any 
value is nearing the acceptable threshold(See error codes). This data will be 
received by the driver display and telemetry systems.


Calibration and DataSheet results
    This section underlines the calibration results from the Hall Effect sensor
and information from the DataSheets necessary to interpret and parse the info
given by the sensors.

Hall effect sensor calibration:
Sensor measurement range:
Sensor output range: 

Formula experimentally determined:
read_adc() = 680.24 * current + 32685

Voltage sensor calibration:
Sensor measurement range:  0.00V .. 4.75V
Sensor output range: 0 .. 1023

Divide value from sensor by 1023 to normalize the range to 0.0 to 1.0, then 
multiply by 5.0? to get the voltage reading from the sensor.

Temperature Sensor Calibration:
Sensor measurement range: -127°C .. 127°C
Sensor output range: -1024 .. 1023

Divide value from sensor by 1023 to normalize the range to -1.0 to 1.0, then 
multiply by 127 to get the temperature reading from the sensor. This is 
effectively the same as dividing by 8 or shifting 3 bits to the right or, 
removing the 3 least significant bits.


Battery Protection System CAN message protocol
    Sends 5 packets over the CAN line, packets are sent every 1000 milliseconds
The packets 0 to 2 have 8 bytes each, packet 3 and 4 have 6 bytes each.
Bytes 0..7 from packet 0 correspond to the voltage readings from sensors 0..7.
Bytes 0..5 from packet 1 correspond to the voltage readings from sensors 8..13.
Byte 6 from packet 1 corresponds to the most significant bit of the hall sensor.
Byte 7 from packet 1 corresponds to the least significant bit of the hall sensor.
Bytes 0..7 from packet 2 correspond to the voltage readings from sensors 0..7.
Bytes 0..5 from packet 3 correspond to the voltage readings from sensors 8..13.


Byte || Packet 0 | Packet 1 | Packet 2 | Packet 3 |       Packet 4 
-----++----------+----------+----------+----------+-------------------------
  0  || 0 - Volt | 8 - Volt | 0 - Temp | 8 - Temp |OVERVOLT  0-7
  1  || 1 - Volt | 9 - Volt | 1 - Temp | 9 - Temp |OVERVOLT  8-13
  2  || 2 - Volt |10 - Volt | 2 - Temp |10 - Temp |UNDERVOLT 0-7
  3  || 3 - Volt |11 - Volt | 3 - Temp |11 - Temp |UNDERVOLT 8-13

8 9 10 11 12 13 x OC

HS  = Hall sensor
MSB = Most Significant Byte
LSB = Least Significant Byte

Packet 4:
All 8 bits of byte 0 and the first 6 bits of byte 1 correspond to the over 
voltage status of each of the 14 sensors. The last 2 bits of byte 2 are 0. All
8 bits of byte 2 and the first 6 bits of byte 3 correspond to the over voltage
status of each of the 14 sensors. The last 2 bits of byte 2 are 0. All 8 bits of
byte 4 and the first 6 bits of byte 5 correspond to the over temperature status
of each of the 14 sensors. The last 2 bits of byte 2 are 0. The least 
significant bit of byte 5 is the warning flag for the hall sensor.


Encoding Example:

data[0] = 0;
data[0] |= sensor[0]  << 7
...
data[0] |= sensor[7]  << 0
data[1] |= sensor[8]  << 5
...
data[1] |= sensor[12] << 1

Decoding Example:

sensor[0]  = (data[0] >> 7) & 1
...
sensor[7]  = (data[0] >> 0) & 1
sensor[8]  = (data[1] >> 5) & 1
sensor[12] = (data[1] >> 0) & 1

When any sensors go over their thresholds (over voltage/under voltage/over
temperature), their bit is set to 1. For example, if bytes 1 and 2 are set to
0x04 and 0x00 respecively, then sensor 4 is in over voltage warning mode.
