Hall effect sensor calibration:
Sensor measurement range:
Sensor output range: 

formula experimentally determined:
read_adc() = 680.24 * current + 32685



Voltage sensor calibration:
Sensor measurement range:  0.00V .. 4.75V
Sensor output range: 0 .. 1024

Divide value from sensor by 1024 to normalize the range to 0.0 to 1.0, then multiply by 5.0? to get the maximum voltage range from the sensor.



Temperature Sensor Calibration:
Sensor measurement range: -127°C .. 127°C
Sensor output range: -1024 .. 1024

Divide value from sensor by 1024 to normalize the range to -1.0 to 1.0, then multiply by 127? to get the maximum temperature range from the sensor. This is effectively the same as dividing by 8 or shifting 3 bits to the right, or, more simply, removing the 3 least significant bits.
