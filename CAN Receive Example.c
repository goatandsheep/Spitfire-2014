/*
 This is example code for a RECEIVING node
 
the following is available at the CCS Index:

can_init(void);
 Initializes the CAN module to 125k baud and clears all the filters and masks so that all messages can be received from any ID.
can_set_baud(void);
 Initializes the baud rate of the CAN bus to 125kHz. It is called inside the can_init() function so there is no need to call it.
can_set_mode(CAN_OP_MODE mode);
 Allows the mode of the CAN module to be changed to configuration mode, listen mode, loop back mode, disabled mode, or normal mode.
can_set_functional_mode(CAN_FUN_OP_MODE mode);
 Allows the functional mode of ECAN modules to be changed to legacy mode, enhanced legacy mode, or first in firstout (fifo) mode. ECAN
can_set_id(int* addr, int32 id, int1 ext);
 Can be used to set the filter and mask ID's to the value specified by addr. It is also used to set the ID of the message to be sent.
can_get_id(int * addr, int1 ext);
 Returns the ID of a received message.
can_putd(int32 id, int * data, int len,int priority, int1 ext, int1 rtr);
 Constructs a CAN packet using the given arguments and places it in one of the available transmit buffers.
can_getd(int32 & id, int * data, int & len,struct rx_stat & stat);
 Retrieves a received message from one of the CAN buffers  and stores the relevant data in the referenced function parameters. 
can_enable_rtr(PROG_BUFFER b);
 Enables the automatic response feature which automatically sends a user created packet when a specified ID is received. ECAN
can_disable_rtr(PROG_BUFFER b);
 Disables the automatic response feature. ECAN 
can_load_rtr(PROG_BUFFER b, int * data, int len);
 Creates and loads the packet that will automatically transmitted when the triggering ID is received. ECAN
can_enable_filter(long filter);
 Enables one of the extra filters included in the ECAN module. ECAN
can_disable_filter(long filter);
 Disables one of the extra filters included in the ECAN module. ECAN
can_associate_filter_to_buffer(CAN_FILTER_ASSOCIATION_BUFFERS buffer,CAN_FILTER_ASSOCIATION filter);
 Used to associate a filter to a specific buffer. This allows only specific buffers to be filtered and is available in the ECAN module. ECAN
can_associate_filter_to_mask(CAN_MASK_FILTER_ASSOCIATE mask,CAN_FILTER_ASSOCIATION filter);
 Used to associate a mask to a specific buffer. This allows only specific buffer to have this mask applied. This feature is available in the ECAN module. ECAN
can_fifo_getd(int32 & id,int * data,int &len,struct rx_stat & stat);
 Retrieves the next buffer in the fifo buffer. Only available in the ECON module while operating in fifo mode. ECAN
 
Relevant Interrupts:
  
 
 #int_canirx  
 This interrupt is triggered when an invalid packet is received on the CAN.
 
#int_canwake
 This interrupt is triggered when the PIC is woken up by activity on the CAN.
 
#int_canerr
 This interrupt is triggered when there is an error in the CAN module.
 
#int_cantx0
 This interrupt is triggered when transmission from buffer 0 has completed.
 
#int_cantx1
 This interrupt is triggered when transmission from buffer 1 has completed.
 
#int_cantx2
 This interrupt is triggered when transmission from buffer 2 has completed.
 
#int_canrx0
 This interrupt is triggered when a message is received in buffer 0.
 
#int_canrx1
 This interrupt is triggered when a message is received in buffer 1.

Example Code:

can_init();
 // initializes the CAN bus
can_putd(0x300,data,8,3,TRUE,FALSE);
 // places a message on the CAN buss with
 // ID = 0x300 and eight bytes of data pointed to by
 // “data”, the TRUE creates an extended ID, the
 // FALSE creates
can_getd(ID,data,len,stat);
 // retrieves a message from the CAN bus storing the
 // ID in the ID variable, the data at the array pointed to by
 // “data', the number of data bytes in len, and statistics
 // about the data in the stat structure.
 
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// can_getd()
//
// Gets data from a receive buffer, if the data exists
//
//    Parameters:
//      int32   &id   - ID who sent message
//      int8    *data - pointer to array of data
//      int8    &len  - length of received data
//      rx_stat &stat - structure holding some information (such as which buffer
//             recieved it, ext or standard, etc)
//
//    Returns:
//      TRUE if there was data in a RX buffer, FALSE otherwise
