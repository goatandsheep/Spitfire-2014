7 segment display bit mapping:
ie: bit 2 corresponds to 0x04

LEFT DIGIT   RIGHT DIGIT
  6666          2222
 5    7        1    3
 5    7        1    3
 5    7        1    3
 5    7        1    3
  4444          0000
 3    1        7    1
 3    1        7    1
 3    1        7    1
 3    1        7    5
  2222  0       6666  4

 Not that bits [0-3] and [4-7] are swapped between the right and left digits.
 This is due to the design of the board and how the seven segment displays are
 wired up.
